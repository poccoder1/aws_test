================================production support =======


Independent Issue Resolution:
During the learning phase, I actively seek opportunities to enhance my technical expertise and problem-solving skills. When confronted with support issues, I adopt a proactive approach to quickly identify and resolve them. I employ thorough investigation techniques, leveraging available resources such as logs, documentation, and knowledge bases. By taking ownership of issues, I strive to minimize the impact on production and ensure a smooth user experience.

Collaboration with Team Members:
    Recognizing the importance of teamwork, I maintain open lines of communication with my colleagues. I actively engage in knowledge-sharing sessions, seeking insights and advice from more experienced team members. By collaborating effectively, I tap into the collective expertise of the team, enabling faster and more accurate issue resolution. Additionally, I offer my assistance to fellow team members, fostering a supportive and cooperative work environment.

Proactive Development Practices:
To ensure production stability, I adopt a proactive mindset during the development phase. Before writing code, I thoroughly analyze requirements and engage in detailed discussions with the team to identify potential corner cases. By considering a wide range of scenarios, I strive to develop robust and resilient solutions that minimize the likelihood of production issues. Through careful planning and diligent coding, I aim to deliver software that meets high-quality standards and is less prone to errors.

Adherence to Coding Standards:
Recognizing the importance of maintainable and reliable code, I strictly adhere to established coding standards and best practices. I diligently follow coding conventions, ensuring consistency and readability in the codebase. By maintaining clean and organized code, I facilitate easier troubleshooting and future enhancements. Moreover, I prioritize the use of defensive programming techniques, implementing error handling mechanisms and input validation to prevent unexpected failures.

Code Review and Merge Request Process:
As an integral part of ensuring production stability, I actively participate in code reviews and merge request processes. I approach these activities with thoroughness and attention to detail, carefully examining the code for potential issues, such as performance bottlenecks, security vulnerabilities, or logic errors. Additionally, I provide constructive feedback to my colleagues, offering suggestions for improvements and ensuring compliance with coding standards. Through this meticulous review process, we collectively strive to deliver production-ready code that minimizes the likelihood of post-deployment issues.


========== AWS migration======
I wanted to provide an update on my performance goals as part of the AWS migration project. Although I did not have prior experience with AWS migration, I took the initiative to work on AWS Glue along with Python and Spark. These technologies were completely new to me, and I dedicated numerous late nights and weekends to understand AWS Glue and create a demo proof of concept (POC).

My focus primarily revolved around AWS Glue and involved creating Terraform code for the Glue pipeline. Additionally, I worked with other AWS services such as S3, Lambda, and established database connectivity with Amazon Aurora MySQL and DynamoDB. One of the challenging aspects of my work was dealing with XML extraction in the Glue ETL process, but I was able to overcome this hurdle successfully. I am grateful for the support provided by Kexin.

To optimize our ETL processes, I also took the initiative to create a dynamic framework that can support multiple file ETL processes. This framework enhances flexibility and reusability, allowing for greater efficiency and scalability in our workflows.

Furthermore, I actively collaborated with other teams throughout the project, assisting them in fitting their requirements into the AWS Glue ecosystem and addressing any issues they encountered. This teamwork and support were essential in ensuring the smooth progress of the AWS migration.

Overall, I am pleased to report that I have made significant progress in mastering AWS Glue and Python with Spark. I have created a demo POC, developed Terraform code for the Glue pipeline, integrated various AWS services, addressed the challenges posed by XML extraction, and established a dynamic framework for multiple file ETL processes. I am confident that these efforts will contribute positively to the success of our AWS migration project.

Thank you for your support and guidance throughout this process. If there are any additional details or areas you would like me to focus on, please let me know. I am eager to continue learning and contributing to the team's success.


===========Application mode=====
Over the course of this period, I have made significant contributions that have positively impacted our application's stability, performance, and deployment efficiency.

One of the key improvements I implemented was the integration of Liquibase, which has greatly facilitated automatic deployment processes. By utilizing Liquibase, we have been able to streamline our deployment workflows, reducing manual effort and increasing efficiency. This implementation has contributed to faster and more reliable deployments, resulting in improved overall productivity and reduced risk of errors.

Additionally, I successfully developed a highly complex Zip file extractor component as part of our application modernization efforts. This extractor not only allows us to extract files from Zip archives but also validates them during subsequent batch runs. The intricate nature of this component required extensive analysis and understanding of various scenarios. I am grateful for the support provided by my colleague [Teammate's Name], who thoroughly explained and documented the different scenarios. This collaboration ensured that the Zip file extractor is robust and capable of handling diverse file extraction requirements.

As an active participant in application architecture discussions, I consistently strive to contribute my expertise to enhance application stability and performance. I proactively offer input and suggestions to promote a stable and efficient application design. By being involved in these discussions, I ensure that our applications are built with scalability, reliability, and maintainability in mind.

Moreover, I continually prioritize application stability and performance in my work. I regularly provide insights and suggestions to optimize code, improve database queries, and enhance overall system efficiency. By diligently focusing on these aspects, I aim to deliver a high-performing application that meets both user expectations and business requirements.



    ================vul=====

To achieve this goal, I regularly perform vulnerability scans and assessments on the jar files used in our application. These scans help identify any known security weaknesses or vulnerabilities that may exist in the versions of the jar files we currently have in use.

Once a vulnerability is detected, my next step is to find the correct and most up-to-date version of the jar file that resolves the identified vulnerability. This involves researching and analyzing various sources, such as vendor websites, security advisories, and vulnerability databases, to determine the appropriate version to upgrade to.

In addition to addressing vulnerabilities, I also consider the overall stability and compatibility of the application. Since we utilize other applications as parent jars in our system, it is essential to keep them up to date as well. By using the latest version of the parent jar, we ensure that any new features or improvements introduced by the parent application are readily available to our application.

This proactive approach helps mitigate security risks by reducing the likelihood of known vulnerabilities being exploited. It also ensures that our application remains compatible with the latest features and updates provided by the parent application, thus enhancing its overall functionality and performance.

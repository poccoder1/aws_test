you need to establish connectivity between your AWS environment and the on-premises network. This involves configuring the necessary network components on both sides. Here's a detailed explanation of the required network configuration for AWS and on-premises connectivity:

AWS VPC Configuration:

Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): Create a VPC in your AWS account to isolate your resources.
Subnets: Set up subnets within the VPC, including public and private subnets. The public subnet should have an internet gateway attached to allow outbound internet connectivity.
Route Tables: Configure the route tables for your subnets. The public subnet should have a route that directs traffic to the internet gateway.
Security Groups: Create a security group for your Glue job to allow inbound and outbound traffic.
Network ACLs: Optionally, you can use Network ACLs to control inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level.
VPN or Direct Connect:

AWS Direct Connect: If you have a dedicated connection between your on-premises network and AWS, you can set up AWS Direct Connect. This establishes a private, dedicated network connection.
VPN Connection: Alternatively, you can use a VPN connection to establish a secure, encrypted tunnel between your on-premises network and the AWS VPC.
On-Premises Network Configuration:

Network Infrastructure: Ensure that your on-premises network is properly configured with network devices such as routers and firewalls.
Outbound Connectivity: Make sure your on-premises network has outbound internet connectivity. This may involve configuring NAT (Network Address Translation) or a proxy server, depending on your network setup.
Firewall Rules: Adjust firewall rules to allow inbound traffic from the AWS VPC subnets and outbound traffic to the Glue job.
Spring Boot Application Configuration:

Endpoint and Port: Make sure your Spring Boot application is running on a fixed endpoint and port. This can be the IP address of the server running the application along with the port number specified in the application's configuration.
Security: If your Spring Boot application requires authentication or authorization, ensure that the necessary credentials or tokens are passed from the Glue job script.
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing): If your Spring Boot application is configured with CORS restrictions, you may need to adjust the CORS settings to allow requests from the AWS VPC IP range.
Glue Job Configuration:

Security Group: Assign the appropriate security group to the Glue job to allow outbound traffic to the on-premises network.
IAM Role: Create an IAM role for the Glue job with the necessary permissions to access the required AWS resources and network components.
Script Configuration: In your Glue job script, use the appropriate HTTP client library or utility (e.g., Python requests library) to send requests to the Spring Boot application's REST API. Provide the endpoint URL and handle any required authentication or authorization.
